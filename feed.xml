However, since its opening in 1995, the airport has been shrouded in controversy and conspiracy theories. In the season finale of The Dark Archive, we will explore the various theories surrounding the airport and try to separate fact from fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We delve into the theory that the airport is home to a secret underground bunker, which is supposedly designed to house government officials and the elite in the event of a catastrophic event. We explore the various murals and artwork that adorn the airport’s walls, which some people believe are evidence of a sinister agenda. Finally, we have to address the big, blue horse on the airport’s doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us as we take a deep dive into the conspiracy theories surrounding Denver International Airport and try to separate fact from fiction. You’ll be surprised at what we uncover! And in our first non-zoom episode!&lt;/p&gt;

Corral. Taking place on October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona, this event has become one of the most enduring legends of the American frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by setting the scene and examining the context of the gunfight. Tombstone was a booming silver mining town, with tensions running high between various factions vying for power and control. The Earp brothers, Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan, were lawmen who had recently arrived in town and were trying to establish themselves as the new enforcers of order. Their nemesis was a group of outlaws known as the Cowboys, led by the infamous Ike Clanton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the episode, we analyze the various myths and legends that have grown up around the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, as well as its lasting cultural impact. From Hollywood movies to TV shows to books and documentaries, the gunfight has been endlessly romanticized and mythologized, often obscuring the actual historical facts. Despite its relatively small scale, the gunfight has come to symbolize the violence, lawlessness, and rugged individualism of the Wild West, and remains one of the most enduring and iconic moments of that era.&lt;/p&gt;

First, we will examine the tragic story of the radium girls, who worked in factories painting watch dials with radioactive paint in the early 20th century. Despite being assured that the paint was safe, the women ingested dangerous levels of radium, which led to cancer and other illnesses. Next, we will explore the origins of the phrase “mad as a hatter” and its connection to the hat-making industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. Hat makers used a chemical called mercury nitrate in the production of felt hats, which led to mercury poisoning among workers. Finally, we delve into the world of breaker boys, young boys who worked in coal mines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, sorting coal from debris using their bare hands. These boys were exposed to dangerous levels of coal dust, which led to chronic respiratory diseases and other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through examining these three cases, we will gain a better understanding of the devastating impact truly toxic workplaces can have on workers and how these tragedies have influenced workplace safety regulations. Join us as we explore the history of these toxic work environments and the lessons we can learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, located on a rocky island off the coast of San Francisco, was considered to be one of the most secure prisons in the world, housing some of the most dangerous criminals of the time. We’ll delve into the events surrounding the Alcatraz escape, including the planning and execution of the escape itself, as well as the aftermath and investigation. We’ll examine the methods used by the escapees, including their intricate plan to dig out of their cells and create lifelike dummy heads to fool the guards during their escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also explore the backgrounds and motivations of the three escapees, Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin, and how their criminal histories and personal experiences led them to attempt such a daring escape. Join us as we uncover the fascinating story of the Alcatraz Escape, a tale of ingenuity, daring, and perseverance that continues to captivate audiences more than half a century later.&lt;/p&gt;

Listener discretion is strongly advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, a wave of hysteria swept through the United States as people became convinced that a vast Satanic conspiracy was at work, corrupting and abusing children. This phenomenon, known as the Satanic Panic, led to numerous high-profile cases of alleged Satanic ritual abuse. But how much of this panic was based in reality, and how much was just a product of fear and hysteria?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, we explore the history of the Satanic Panic, from its origins in the early 80s, to its eventual decline in the 90s, to how it’s coming back in the modern day. We also take a closer look at some of the most famous cases of the Satanic Panic, including the McMartin preschool trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we reflect on the legacy of the Satanic Panic and the lessons we can learn from this troubling episode in American history. We consider the harm caused to innocent people and the damage done to the credibility of law enforcement and child protection agencies, and we explore the broader implications for our society today. Whether you’re a fan of true crime or simply interested in the social and cultural history of the United States, this episode is sure to provoke thought and discussion. So tune in as we separate fact from fiction and try to make sense of the Satanic Panic of the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
